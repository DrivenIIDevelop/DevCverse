# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Frontend Development Setup

To run the frontend on your local development environment, navigate to the frontend folder from the root directory, in your terminal, run the below commands:

1. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the server in a development environment.

If you would like to run the frontend in a local production environment, run the below commands in your terminal:

1. Run `npm run build` to create a production build.
2. Run `npm run preview` to serve the production-ready files.
